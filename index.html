A human being is part of the whole, called by us 'Universe'; a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself,
his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest -- a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
<br>
This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and affection for a few persons nearest us.
<br>
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.
<br>
Nobody is able to achieve this completely but striving for such achievement is, in itself, a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.
